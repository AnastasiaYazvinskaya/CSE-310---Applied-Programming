# Development Environment

The tools that I used to develop software are Code::Blocks (C++ IDE).

This programm was written in C++ programming language. The following libraries were also required: iostream, iomanip, ctime, string, locale, Windows.h, fstream, conio.h, vector, sstream.

# Future Work

* Create an algorithm for generating your own Sudoku boards.
* Make the game off-console. Create a window for the game so that you can interact not only with the keys, but also with the mouse to hover over the desired cell.
* Saving Sudoku boards in svg format: make it possible to save a new board as a separate image even after restarting the application. (At the moment, the picture is being updated, creating a new one in the same file)
