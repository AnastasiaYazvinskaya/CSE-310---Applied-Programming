# Overview

This is a simple snake game where the user has to control the movement of the snake in order to collect as many fruits as possible. But you have to be careful that the snake doesn't start eating itself.

The purpose of this application is entertainment. So that the user can just spend time and relax with a simple game.

# Development Environment

The tools that I used to develop software are VSCode and the corresponding extensions for working with the Java language. I also actively used Git and its version control system.

This programm was written in Java programming language. The following libraries were also required: javax.swing.JFrame (Main window to create a GUI), javax.swing.JPanel (Container class for attachment any other component), java.util.Random (Crerate random numbers), java.awt (Used to develop GUI and Event Handling), javax.swing (Used to create window-based application).

# Future Work

{Make a list of things that you need to fix, improve, and add in the future.}
* Add start menu
* After the game ends add a restart or the option to exit.
* Maybe make the snake appear on the other side of the screen when going abroad.
